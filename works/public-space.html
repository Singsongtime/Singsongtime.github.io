        <p><b>NOTES ON PERFORMANCE PROCEDURE</b><br>
[Setting: a walk along a wall covered in Graffiti]<br><br>

<h4>Preparation</h4><br>
	Three stations are marked, each out of ear-shot from the other, yet only a short walking apart. Before the performance, some of the short texts written in graffiti at each station are encoded, letter by letter, into musical tones and parameters for moving the body. Each text corresponds to a little performance of song and dance. Before the audience arrives, Alena waits at Station 1 (S. 1), Dakota waits at Station 2 (S. 2), Mathilde and Wyatt waits at Station 3 (S. 3). Alena or a third party, with the exception of Wyatt, Dakota, or Mathilde, is asked beforehand to guide the audience to S. 1 -- without passing by the other stations. 
<br><br>
<h4>Performance</h4><br>	
	As the audience arrives first at S. 1, Alena performs, for around two minutes, two different texts at her station. Alena repeats each text for about one minute, pausing between each repetition, pausing slightly longer on switching from the first to the second text.
	<br>Dakota, now at S. 2, cues Alena to stop by yelling in the direction of S. 1 one of the texts unique to S. 2. Immediately after yelling, Dakota starts to perform the first of his two texts. Alena abruptly stops performing upon hearing the yell, and then proceeds to silently guide the audience to S. 2. Upon arrival at S. 2, Alena performs two unique texts, texts corresponding to S. 2, simlutaneous with Dakota, yet rhythmically unsynchronized. From the moment Alena begins perform at S. 2, both Aleana and Dakota continue to repeat the texts for about one minute, pausing between each repetition, pausing slightly longer on switching from the one text to the second text.
	<br>Mathilde and Wyatt, at S. 3, cue Alena and Dakota to stop by each yelling in the direction of S. 2 one of the texts unique to S. 3. Immediately after yelling, Mathilde and Wyatt simultaneously begin to perform the first of their two unique texts, yet rhythmically unsynchronized with one another. Dakota and Alena abruptly stop performing upon hearing the yell, and then proceed to silently guide the audience to S. 3. Upon arrival at S. 3, Alena and Dakota each perform two texts unique to S. 3, simultaneous with one another, yet rhymthmically unsychronized with one another as well as with Wyatt and Mathilde. From the moment Alena and Dakota begin to perform at S. 3, all of the performers continue to repeat the texts for about two minutes, pausing between each repetition, pausing slightly longer on switching from the one text to the second text. Directly after these two minutes have passed, the whole group yells into the air the final word or phrase that they had just performed.
