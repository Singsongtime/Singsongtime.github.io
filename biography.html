    <br>  
    <p>Wyatt wakefield (b. 1994) was born in Morro Bay, California. He has been educated at Cuesta College in 
     San Luis Obispo and at Temple University in Philadelphia, and his teachers have included Charlie Shoemake and Matthew Greenbaum. 
     Currently, he is studying with Klaus Lang at the Kunstuniversi√§t Graz.<br><br>
     On the Central Coast of California, his early musical life was predominated by expression in improvised music: the playing with others, amatuers/non-specialists, in an informal, openly participatory manner.
     To continue in this way with more seriousness, wyatt chose to attend a local college to learn formal improvisation methods and entered a study program called Jazz Studies.
     His motives for stopping these studies are not fully clear to him, but he has the feeling of having wanted to create music that
     was not in relation to the limits of his then-practice.
