    <p>Wyatt wakefield (b. 1994) was born in Morro Bay, California. He has been educated at Cuesta College in 
     San Luis Obispo and at Temple University in Philadelphia---his teachers have included Charlie Shoemake and Matthew Greenbaum. 
     Currently, he is studying with Klaus Lang at the Kunstuniversi√§t Graz.<br><br><img src="portrait.jpg" class="bio-pic"><br><br>
     
     He grew up on both coasts of the United States and, in each location, entered into a different musical culture. As a child in the Philadelphia suburbs, 
     he learned to read music, playing trumpet in his school marching band. 
     On the central coast of California, his early musical life was predominated by improvised music: the playing with others, amatuers/non-specialists, in an informal, participatory manner.
     After finishing high school, he decided to become serious about improvised music and enrolled in the local community college, where he entered a study program called Jazz Studies, led by Ron McCarly.
     Although his motives for stopping these studies are not fully clear to him, he has the feeling of having wanted to create music that
     was not in relation to the limits of his then-practice.  .  .  .   .   .
